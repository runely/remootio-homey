# Remootio

Make your Homey even smarter by controlling your gates and garage doors with Remootio

## Websocket API

If you are or want to use Device API, go to Device API instead

### Prerequisites :man_mechanic:

- **Your Remootio device is already set up**
- **Make sure your Remootio and Homey is on the same network / VLAN**
- **The status sensor is installed and enabled in the Remootio app (Homey needs to know the current state of your gate/garage door)**
- **A static/fixed IP address for your Remootio is recommended**
- ***Output configuration* for your Remootio device *MUST* be set to one of these:**
    - **Output 1: disabled Output 2: gate impulse control**
    - **Output 1: gate impulse control Output 2: free relay output**
    - **Output 1: free relay output Output 2: gate impulse control**
    - **Output 1 & Output 2: gate impulse control**
    - **Output 1: gate impulse control Output 2: disabled**

#### Websocket API

The API in the Remootio must be enabled before adding Remootio device(s) to Homey. Instructions [here](https://documents.remootio.com/docs/WebsocketApiDocs.pdf)

Take a note of the `API Secret Key` and `API Auth Key` shown when enabling the API

#### Which driver to use

##### Remootio (gate impulse control)

This driver supports the following Output configurations:
- **Output 1: disabled Output 2: gate impulse control**
- **Output 1 & Output 2: gate impulse control**
- **Output 1: gate impulse control Output 2: disabled**

##### Remootio (Output 1: gate impulse control, Output 2: free relay output)

This driver supports the following Output configuration:
- **Output 1: gate impulse control Output 2: free relay output**

> Keep in mind that the `status sensor` only senses state changes on **Output 1**

> **Output 2** will be a stateless toggle (Homey will show different states when toggled, but this state don't necessarily reflect the actual state for **Output 2**)

##### Remootio (Output 1: free relay output, Output 2: gate impulse control)

This driver supports the following Output configuration:
- **Output 1: free relay output Output 2: gate impulse control**

> Keep in mind that the `status sensor` only senses state changes on **Output 2**

> **Output 1** will be a stateless toggle (Homey will show different states when toggled, but this state don't necessarily reflect the actual state for **Output 1**)

##### Pairing

When adding a Remootio device to your Homey, you can choose to find it automatically on your network with mDNS, or you can add it manually

> :exclamation: Remootio3 with Software version >= 2.40 `MUST` be added manually because **mDNS** support is currently **not available** because Remootio has rewritten the Software to support `HomeKit` and in the process borked **mDNS** support

- When asked, input your `API Secret Key` and `API Auth Key` -> Found in **Websocket API configuration in your Remootio app on your phone**
- Choose `Find devices (mDNS)` to find your device(s) automatically on your network with mDNS
- Choose `Manually add device` to manually set **Name**, **Serial Number** and **IP address** of your device

###### Settings

**Flipped logic**

If you have flipped the logic (in the Remootio app) used on the sensor connected to your Remootio device, you must set `Is sensor logic flipped` to `yes` in the Remootio device settings in Homey.

###### Troubleshooting

First, consider this:
```
The physical Remootio device:
- does not use the `Websocket API` itself. This API is only used for 3.party apps/services who wants to talk to the device.
- is limited to `1` WiFi connection at a time! This means:
    - That when the Homey app is connected through the API, you can not use the Remootio app on your phone to connect to the device through WiFi (though through internet and bluetooth connection it will still work) and vica versa.
    - That when you are connected to the device via WiFi through the Remootio app on your phone, you can not connect the Homey app through the API

If you have a WiFi connection open from your phone (or any other device other than the Homey app), to get the Homey app reconnected you must restart the physical Remootio device, and then reconnect the device through the Homey app!

These are limitations with the physical Remootio device itself!
```

- `Device shows incorrect status of the gate/garage door`
  1. Make sure `Is sensor logic flipped` setting on the Device in Homey is set equal to `Flip logic` setting in the Remootio app
  2. Make sure you have chosen the correct driver for your Output configuration
- `Device doesn't change status when gate/garage door is opened/closed externally (by button or Remootio app etc.)`
  1. Make sure **Websocket API** is enabled with logging
- `Device not found in pairing`
  1. Make sure your Remootio device is successfully setup
  2. Make sure you have enabled Wi-Fi on your Remootio device
  3. Make sure your Remootio device is on the same Wi-Fi network as your Homey
  4. Make sure your Remootio device isn't already added as a device in Homey (serial number on the device is used as an identifier, and will only be allowed to be added once)
  5. IF your device is a Remootio3 and has software >= 2.40, the device `MUST` be added manually because **mDNS** support is currently **not available** because Remootio has rewritten the Software to support `HomeKit` and in the process borked **mDNS** support
- `Device unavailable with error`: <b><u>Authentication or encryption error -- Remootio has disconnected. Check your Wi-Fi connection to the device. Too many failed reconnect attempts...</u></b>
  1. Make sure you have entered the correct `API Secret Key` and `API Auth Key`.
  2. Too many failed connect attempts to a Remootio device will brake the websocket client.<br>Restarting the app or setting new auth settings for the device will create a new websocket client

For any other issues, see [Remootio Installation Guide](https://documents.remootio.com/docs/Remootio_Installation_Guide.pdf) for installation instructions and troubleshooting

## Device API

If you are or want to use Websocket API, go to Websocket API instead

### Prerequisites for Device API :man_mechanic:

- **Your Remootio device is already set up**
- **For the Device API your Homey and Remootio can be on different LAN's or WAN's**
- **The status sensor is installed and enabled in the Remootio app (Homey needs to know the current state of your gate/garage door)**
- ***Output configuration* for your Remootio device *MUST* be set to one of these:**
    - **Output 1: disabled Output 2: gate impulse control**
    - **Output 1: gate impulse control Output 2: free relay output**
    - **Output 1: free relay output Output 2: gate impulse control**
    - **Output 1 & Output 2: gate impulse control**
    - **Output 1: gate impulse control Output 2: disabled**

#### Device API

The Device API is hosted on Remootio's servers, so your Remootio device must have internet access and be reachable by the Device API

:exclamation: The Device API is limited to 300 requests per 20 days (this is Remootio's limits!). This means you should be able to open and close your gate/garage door around 6 times a day.<br />If you exceed this limit you will not be able to send requests to the Device API for a while (not sure about the time frame)!

:exclamation: There is an automatic query status (disabled by default), which can be configured to automatically query the gate/garage door status every x hours.<br />You should keep this disabled or use with a very high value, for instance every 7 hours or higher, to not overuse number of queries which will cause you to not being able to call the Device API!

:exclamation: If the gate/garage door is operated outside the Remootio app, the status in the Remootio app will NOT reflect this until it's been toggled in the Remootio app in Homey, or when the automatic query status is run (if enabled)

To allow the Device API to control your Remootio device you must set up an App-Free key through the Remootio app on your phone:
- Go to shared keys
- Click `Share a new key` and choose `Share unique key (recommended)`
- Give the key a meaningful name
- On the next screen click on `App-free key` and click on `Share link`
- Copy only the `token` value from the URL. You must add this value to the Remootio app on Homey under "pairing"

##### Which driver to use

###### Remootio Device API

This driver is the only driver that supports the Device API of Remootio.

##### Pairing

When adding a Remootio device to your Homey, copy in the `token` value found in the previous steps. The pairing process will query the Device API using the `token` value and find info about the device.

###### Settings

**Seconds for status change**

Number of seconds before the gate/garage door has changed status after being operated.<br />A query is sent to the device api after this amount of seconds to set the correct device status. This is done to make sure the device status has the same status as the Remootio device.

**Hours between status queries**

Number of hours between each query for gate/garage door status. Set to 0 to disable automatic status queries<br />As Remootio's Device API has a very low request limit, use this setting with caution!

###### Troubleshooting

- `Device doesn't change status when gate/garage door is opened/closed externally (by button or Remootio app etc.)`
  1. This is by design. The device API is limited to 300 requests per 20 days, so in order not to go beyond the limit, the device status is not updated automatically but only when the device status changes from the Remootio app in Homey
- `Device not found in pairing`
  1. Make sure your Remootio device is successfully setup 
  2. Make sure you have enabled Wi-Fi on your Remootio device
  3. Make sure you have successfully created an App-Free key, and that key's `token` value is actually used in the Remootio app in Homey (Repair)
  4. Make sure your Remootio device isn't already added as a device in Homey (serial number on the device is used as an identifier, and will only be allowed to be added once)
- `Device unavailable with error`: <b><u>Device API not reachable : ...</u></b>
  1. Make sure your Remootio device has Wi-Fi enabled and has internet access
  2. If the error is `429 - Too Many Requests`, you have exceeded the Device API of 300 requests and must wait until Remootio lets you back in!
- `Device unavailable with error`: <b><u>Device API query failed : ...</u></b>
  1. Make sure the `token` value you have added is working. You can test the token by visiting this Remootio site and use the token. If you can connect to your device, the token is valid: https://device.remootio.com/
